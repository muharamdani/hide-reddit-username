## HOW TO INSTALL
- go to extensions on your web browser
- enable developer mode
- drag and drop hide_reddit_username_extension.crx to extensions page
- a popup will appear with a description of reading browsing history (in my case), ignore that and click add extension. You can check init.js and content.js, there's no any sus code that send your browsing history to me, this happen because I'm using tabs permission in manifest.json.
